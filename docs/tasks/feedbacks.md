Kei:
1. I think an interview session should last no more than 30 minutes. AI agent should prompt the time and guide the user to stop the interview session and take a break (So the data can be saved up until that point.)
2. My overall interview would have taken 90+ minutes at the pace it was going....
3. The Japanese text that's showing on-screen is not super accurate - but what the voice agent has captured and recited is accurate. (So there's a discrepancy between voice and text changer.)
4. Interviewer Questions should also appear as text - so the interviewee can 'read it' and refer back to it.
5. The text display is super fragmented. Why is that? My answers are chopped up into so many smaller chunks is that is distracting.
6. The interviewer AI recites my answers 'every time' and that is super annoying. I wish a human an ask me the question and not a machine.
7. The coverage progress meter idea is good and bad. Good that it shows progress, Bad that whether the answers gathered through the interview session amounts to be 80% of overall or not... that determination is usually made by the human. When I was answering questions about AI prototyping and training, I felt I gave no more than 30% of my expertise yet the progress meter was already showing 80%

Eric:
1. I chose new employee onboarding for Dimes, tested on my iphone13.
2. AI Interview : I was impressed that AI was trying to ask me to talk more, I’d like to see a knowledge graph to guide me through what points to say in terms of new employee onboarding. Without it, it’s hard to know why the progress bar gone up to 80%. We shall display the knowledge graph showing which 80% was covered and which 20% is yet to be answered.
3. I found that after speaking for a minutes or so, the phone screen will become locked, thus I need to unlock every couple minutes.
4. AI could summarize what I said but it could consume extra time to clarify on every answers. Probably we shall show the summarized points on screen to allow user to only clarify when it is wrongly recognized.
5. I couldn’t see the final script after speaking for 30 minutes. I agreed with Kei that somehow speaking to AI might feel tired and let’s test it more to find out the magic number X mins.
6. I couldn’t seem to be able to see any result on the dashboard.
7. optional thought: On continuously usage perspective, shall we make it a habit for employee to offer their highlight/lowlight once a week for less than 10mins for instance => then we could use that data to create weekly report for their managers / or weekly meeting for transparency.
